## Stable Diffusion:
[Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion), developed by Stability AI, is an open-source generative AI model capable of creating high-quality images. I run this model on my personal cloud server to explore the intersection of art and AI technology. Below are some of my favorite artworks produced using Stable Diffusion.
